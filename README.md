# spam-sms-detection
It is a  machine learning  project based on classification.
Generally we recieve so many sms in our day to day life,in those sms some are useful,and some may not be useful.
In this busy world we dont have time to distinguish between useful and not useful sms.


By using this machine learning model we can classify which sms is useful and which sms is spam.
I trained this ml model with some previous data which is already classified.
This is is supervised technique of machine learning.
I used logistic regression algorithm to classify data,it gave me more efficient results than other alogorithms while testing.
